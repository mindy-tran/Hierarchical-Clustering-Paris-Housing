# Hierarchical-Clustering-Paris-Housing
Machine Learning: Compare agglomerative and divisive clustering on Paris housing data.

Mindy Tran Project for Machine Learning for Data Science, Winter 2023

In this project I apply two different hierarchical clustering algorithms (agglomerative and divisive) to cluster Paris housing data from Kaggle.

**************************************************************************************************
Go to this website to download the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aleshagavrilov/parishousing/code
	
Task 0: Setup. Install the required libraries for this project by running the following commands:

pip install scikit-learn

pip install pandas

pip install scipy

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib

**************************************************************************************************
Task 1: Run $python clean_data.py 
	which takes the dataset ParisHousing.csv and gives an output of the cleaned_data.csv dataset


Task 2: Run $python main01.py 
	which uses the agglomerative algorithm to cluster and uses the visualization.py file to make an elbow plot, clustering visual, and a boxplot to compare the clusters.


Task 3: Run $python main02.py 
	which uses the divisive algorithm to cluster and uses the visualization.py file to make an elbow plot, clustering visual, and a boxplot to compare the clusters.
